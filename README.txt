Self contained zip folder containing all files required to convert CST simulation file into the format expected from the HEL-FC readout (SimulationParser) and then use that expected output to plot the beam and give some metrics about it's shape.

Included are 7 simulation results and their conversion. The files appended with "_cupped" are the converted files. 

Run the reconstruction file (HELReconstruction) on any of the files (the option to change the file is in the notebook), and compare to the actual shape of the simulated beam.

The .ipynb files are written to run in Jupyter, CERN offers an online version of Juptyer in the form of Swan. (https://swan.web.cern.ch/swan/)

Simply initiate an instance, extract these files to the SWAN_projects location that should be autogenerated in your directory, open, and run.

When it comes to the fits the RMS is the key to seeing how well they match. Tt should be on the order of 1e-3 to be a reasonable fit, 1e-5 is a good fit.
